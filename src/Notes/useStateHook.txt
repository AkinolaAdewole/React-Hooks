useState Hook:
The useState hook allows you to add state to a functional component. 
It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state. 

You can initialize the state with an initial value when calling useState. 

Here's an example:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

In the above code, the useState hook is used to add a count state variable to the component's state. The initial value of count is set to 0. 
The setCount function is used to update the count state when the button is clicked.
